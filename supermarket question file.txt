What is the average wholesale price for each Category Name (e.g., 'Edible Mushroom') across the entire period in annex3.csv?

Identify the Top 5 items with the highest and lowest average wholesale price over the entire available period.

Calculate the month-over-month (MoM) percentage change in the average wholesale price for the overall category.

Determine the most volatile item by calculating the standard deviation of its wholesale price over time, and rank the top 10.

What is the average price of items with a Loss Rate (%) greater than 15% compared to items with a Loss Rate less than 5%? 

📦 II. Inventory & Loss Rate Analysis
Which Category Name has the highest average Loss Rate (%)?

List all Item Names that have a Loss Rate (%) of 0.00 and their corresponding Category Name.

Identify the 5 most valuable items lost by calculating Average Wholesale Price * Loss Rate (%) and ranking them. This can help prioritize inventory management efforts.

Plot the 3-year trend (monthly or quarterly average) of the wholesale price for the top 3 items by Quantity_sold

Which day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) or which month exhibits the highest/lowest average wholesale prices?

Find the largest single-day price drop (in absolute RMB) for any item in the dataset.

💰 IV. Sales & Performance Analysis (Using Hypothetical annex2 Data)
Calculate the total sales revenue for each Category Name by multiplying Unit Selling Price (RMB/kg) from annex2.csv and Sales Volume (kg) from the hypothetical annex2 data.
